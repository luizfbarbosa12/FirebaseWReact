# FirebaseWReact
A project to practice the use of Firebase and React.

On this project, the goal was to learn the different possible uses of firebase products. I implemented:
- Firestore database
-  Firebase Hosting
-  Firebase Cloud Functions 
-  Firebase Authentication.

## Styling

All the styling was made with Styled-components. I used as a basis for the creation of layout and colors, the WhatsApp Web application
